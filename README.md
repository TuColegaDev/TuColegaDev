## 🧑🏻‍💻 Let me tell you about me
> 
> About the year 2016 I began to study as a programmer in higher level professional formation. When I finished my studies, I start working in a different sector than the one I had been preparing for and in which I performed various functions that had nothing to do with what I had learned in past years.
> 
> However, during these years I have acquired skills related to the commercial sector and cooperative work environments and for objectives that I would not have developed in other jobs.
> 
> Nowadays I have decided to return to what I could invest countless hours and fill me with energy. I am currently employed as a backend developer in [OpenBootcamp](https://open-bootcamp.com/) in which I am also training as a Full Stack developer in technologies such as React JS, Spring and Node JS. Developing projects totally oriented to the labor sector.
> 
> On the other hand, I continue to develop personally with writers, content creators and philosophies that help me in my day to day and connect my professional, sentimental and personal environment.
